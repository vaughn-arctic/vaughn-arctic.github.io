### My time in the military
Serving as a paratrooper in the US Army, my role was a Chemical, Bilogical, Radiological and Nuclear Specialist. Needless to say I didn't have very many real world oppurtunites to contribute my speciality, so I sought out ways to help my unit both at home and abroad. I've worn multiple hats such as armorer, fire marshall, saftey coordinator, air movement officer, training and planning manager and have even conducted multiple patrols in a hostile enviornment. 

With each new skill I aquired, I had to familiarize myself with a new set of technology that accompanied it ranging from SIPR networks and Celluar Single Jamming Devices. I was priviledged to work with some of the most cutting edge systems in the world by being a part of a Military Intelligence unit.
